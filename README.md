# music-beat-detector
A prototype of a beat detection engine for future games and whatnot.

# Development
Even though it's in Lua, the core of this project is currently in R. While I'm not sure if I want to keep working with Lua, I definitely need to incorporate the spectrum flux and onset detection algorithms into the main application. I chose R simply because it is easy to prototype things. I could move everything to Python, but that may limit my options for game development. On the other hand, it may facilitate the continued development of the detection algorithms. So...

# TO-DO
- Move everything to Python as a prototype
- Improve detection algorithms
- Move everything to the main language (TBD) for all parts of the project
- Do something with it
